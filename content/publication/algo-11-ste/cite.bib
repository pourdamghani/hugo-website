 abstract = {Current peer-to-peer (P2P) systems often suffer from a
large fraction of freeriders not contributing any resources to the
network. Various mechanisms have been designed to overcome this
problem. However, the selfish behavior of peers has aspects which
go beyond resource sharing. This paper studies the effects on the
topology of a P2P network if peers selfishly select the peers to
connect to. In our model, a peer exploits locality properties in
order to minimize the latency (or response times) of its lookup
operations. At the same time, the peer aims at not having to
maintain links to too many other peers in the system. By giving
tight bounds on the price of anarchy, we show that the resulting
topologies can be much worse than if peers collaborated. Moreover,
the network may never stabilize, even in the absence of churn.
Finally, we establish the complexity of Nash equilibria in our game
theoretic model of P2P networks. Specifically, we prove that it is
NP-hard to decide whether our game has a Nash equilibrium and can
stabilize.},
