 abstract = {Traceroute measurements are one of our main instruments
to shed light onto the structure and properties of today's complex
networks such as the Internet. This paper studies the feasibility
and infeasibility of inferring the network topology given traceroute
data from a worst-case perspective, i.e., without any probabilistic
assumptions on, e.g., the nodes' degree distribution. We attend to
a scenario where some of the routers are anonymous, and propose
two fundamental axioms that model two basic assumptions on the
traceroute data: (1) each trace corresponds to a real path in the
network, and (2) the routing paths are at most a factor 1/$α$
off the shortest paths, for some parameter $α$ $ın$ (0, 1]. In
contrast to existing literature that focuses on the cardinality of
the set of (often only minimal) inferrable topologies, we argue that
a large number of possible topologies alone is often unproblematic,
as long as the networks have a similar structure. We hence seek
to characterize the set of topologies inferred with our axioms.
We introduce the notion of star graphs whose colorings capture
the differences among inferred topologies; it also allows us to
construct inferred topologies explicitly. We find that in general,
inferrable topologies can differ significantly in many important
aspects, such as the nodes' distances or the number of triangles.
These negative results are complemented by a discussion of a
scenario where the trace set is best possible, i.e., ''complete''. It
turns out that while some properties such as the node degrees are
still hard to measure, a complete trace set can help to determine
global properties such as the connectivity.")"},
