 abstract = {Until now, the analysis of fault tolerance of peer-to-peer
systems usually only covers random faults of some kind. Contrary
to traditional algorithmic research, faults as well as joins and
leaves occurring in a worst-case manner are hardly considered. In
this paper, we devise techniques to build dynamic peer-to-peer
systems which remain fully functional in spite of an adversary which
continuously adds and removes peers. We exemplify our algorithms on
a pancake topology and present a system which maintains peer degree
and network diameter ıt O(log n/log log n), where ıt n is the
total number of peers in the system.},
