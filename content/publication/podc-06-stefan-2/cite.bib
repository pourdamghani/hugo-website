 abstract = {Over the last years, game theory has provided great
insights into the behavior of distributed systems by modeling the
players as utility-maximizing agents. In particular, it has been
shown that selfishness causes many systems to perform in a globally
suboptimal fashion. Such systems are said to have a large Price of
Anarchy. In this paper, we extend this active field of research
by allowing some players to be malicious or Byzantine rather than
selfish. We ask: What is the impact of Byzantine players on the
system's efficiency compared to purely selfish environments or
compared to the social optimum? In particular, we introduce the
Price of Malice which captures this efficiency degradation. As an
example, we analyze the Price of Malice of a game which models the
containment of the spread of viruses. In this game, each node can
choose whether or not to install anti-virus software. Then, a virus
starts from a random node and iteratively infects all neighboring
nodes which are not inoculated. We establish various results about
this game. For instance, we quantify how much the presence of
Byzantine players can deteriorate or---in case of highly risk-averse
selfish players---improve the social welfare of the distributed
system.},
