 abstract = {Intentional interference constitutes a major threat
for communication networks operating over a shared medium where
availability is imperative. Jamming attacks are often simple and
cheap to implement. Today's jammers can perform physical carrier
sensing in order to disrupt communication more efficiently,
especially in a network of simple wireless devices such as
sensor nodes, which usually operate over a single frequency (or
a limited frequency band) and which cannot benefit from the use
of spread spectrum or other more advanced technologies. This
paper proposes the medium access (MAC) protocol ANTIJAM which is
provably robust against a powerful reactive adversary who can jam
a (1-$ɛ$)-portion of the time steps, where $ɛ$
is an arbitrary constant. The adversary uses carrier sensing to
make informed decisions on when it is most harmful to disrupt
communications. Moreover, we allow the adversary to be adaptive
and to have complete knowledge of the entire protocol history.
Our MAC protocol is able to make efficient use of the nonjammed
time periods and achieves a $Θ$(1)-competitive throughput in
this harsh scenario, if $ɛ$ is constant. In addition,
ANTIJAM features a low convergence time and has excellent fairness
properties in the sense that channel access probabilities among
nodes do not differ by more than a small constant factor.},
