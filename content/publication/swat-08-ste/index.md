abstract: "Assume a set of distributed nodes which are equipped with a sensor device. When nodes sense an event, they want to know (the size of) the connected component consisting of nodes which have also sensed the event, in order to raise--if necessary--a disaster alarm. This paper presents distributed algorithms for this problem. Concretely, our algorithms aim at minimizing both the response time as well as the message complexity."
