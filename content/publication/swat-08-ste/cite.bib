 abstract = {Assume a set of distributed nodes which are equipped with
a sensor device. When nodes sense an event, they want to know (the
size of) the connected component consisting of nodes which have
also sensed the event, in order to raise--if necessary--a disaster
alarm. This paper presents distributed algorithms for this problem.
Concretely, our algorithms aim at minimizing both the response time
as well as the message complexity.},
