 abstract = {We present a dynamic distributed hash table where peers
may join and leave at any time. Our system tolerates a powerful
adversary which has complete visibility of the entire state
of the system and can continuously add and remove peers. Our
system provides worst-case fault-tolerance, maintaining desirable
properties such as a low peer degree and a low network diameter.},
