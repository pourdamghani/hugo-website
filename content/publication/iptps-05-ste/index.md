abstract: "We present a dynamic distributed hash table where peers may join and leave at any time. Our system tolerates a powerful adversary which has complete visibility of the entire state of the system and can continuously add and remove peers. Our system provides worst-case fault-tolerance, maintaining desirable properties such as a low peer degree and a low network diameter."
