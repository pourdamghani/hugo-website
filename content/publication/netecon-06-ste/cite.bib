 abstract = {Peer-to-peer (p2p) systems have the potential to harness
huge amounts of resources. Unfortunately, however, it has been shown
that most of today's p2p networks suffer from a large fraction
of free-riders, who consume resources without contributing much
to the system themselves. This results in an overall performance
degradation, and hence proper incentives are needed to encourage
contributions. One interesting resource is bandwidth. Thereby, a
service differentiation approach seems appropriate, where peers
contributing higher upload bandwidths are rewarded with higher
download bandwidths in return. Keeping track of the contribution
of each peer in an open, decentralized environment, however, is
a difficult task; many proposed systems are susceptible to false
reports. Besides being prone to attacks, some solutions have a
large communication and computation overhead, which can even be
linear in the number of transactions---an unacceptable burden in
practical and active systems. In this paper, we propose a reputation
system which is robust to false reports and overcomes this scaling
problem. Our results are promising, indicating that the mechanism
is accurate and efficient especially when applied in systems where
there are lots of transactions. For a more detailed technical
report, we refer the reader to the TIK Report 246 (available at
http://www.tik.ee.ethz.ch/).},
