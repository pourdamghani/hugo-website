 abstract = {This paper studies throughput maximization in networks
with dynamically changing congestion. First, we give a new and
simple analysis of an existing model where the bandwidth available
to a flow varies multiplicatively over time. The main contribution
however is the introduction of a novel model for dynamics based on
concepts of network calculus. This model features a limited form
of amortization: After quiet times where the available bandwidth
was roughly constant, the congestion may change more abruptly. We
present a competitive algorithm for this model and also derive a
lower bound.},
