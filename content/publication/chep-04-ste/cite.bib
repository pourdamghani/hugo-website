 abstract = {LHC experiments have large amounts of software to build.
CMS has studied ways to shorten project build times using parallel
and distributed builds as well as improved ways to decide what to
rebuild. We have experimented with making idle desktop and server
machines easily available as a virtual build cluster using distcc
and zeroconf. We have also tested variations of ccache and more
traditional make dependency analysis. We report on our test results,
with analysis of the factors that most improve or limit build
performance.},
