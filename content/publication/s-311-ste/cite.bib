 abstract = {The efficient coordination of medium access is arguably
one of the most relevant applications of distributed computing.
Recently, progress has been made in the design of robust medium
access (MAC) protocols that guarantee a competitive throughput
against a powerful jammer which can block the medium an arbitrary
constant fraction (1-$ε$) of the time. These MAC protocols
exploit the remaining $ε$-fraction optimally in the sense
that a significant part is used for successful transmissions.
However, so far these throughput guarantees only hold for rather
simplistic interference models such as Unit Disk Graphs. This paper
reports on our first insights on the design of a robust medium
access protocol SinrMac for the more realistic physical interference
model which takes into account the signal to interference plus noise
ratio (SINR) at the receiver. This model is more difficult, as
there is no longer an objective distinction of idling and busy time
periods which can be used to dynamically adjust the wireless nodes'
backoff periods. We discuss an approach that introduces individual
``idle/busy thresholds'' which are adapted dynamically and, unlike
the multiplicative backoff periods, in an ıt additive manner. We
find that a reasonable convergence speed (and throughput) can be
achieved if there exists some meaningful upper bound $τ$
on the noise level in the network; surprisingly, however, our first
simulation results indicate that adaptive changes of the idly/busy
thresholds do not yield a better throughput than static thresholds
set to $τ$.},
