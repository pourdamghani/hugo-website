abstract: "Data dissemination in decentralized networks is often realized by using some form of swarming technique. Swarming enables nodes to gather dynamically in order to fulfill a certain task collaboratively and to exchange resources (typically pieces of files or packets of a multimedia data stream). As in most distributed systems, swarming applications face the problem that the nodes in a network have heterogeneous capabilities or act selfishly. We investigate the problem of efficient live data dissemination (e.g., TV streams) in swarms. The live streams should be distributed in such a way that only nodes with sufficiently large contributions to the system are able to fully receive it---even in the presence of freeloading nodes or nodes that upload substantially less than required to sustain the multimedia stream. In contrast, uncooperative nodes cannot properly receive the data stream as they are unable to fill their data buffers in time, incentivizing a fair sharing of resources. If the number of selfish nodes increases, our emulation results reveal that the situation steadily deteriorates for them, while obedient nodes continue to receive virtually all packets in time."
