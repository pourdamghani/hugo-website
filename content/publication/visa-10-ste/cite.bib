 abstract = {Network virtualization promises a high flexibility by
decoupling services from the underlying substrate network and
allowing the virtual network to adapt to the needs of the service,
e.g., by migrating servers or/and parts of the network. We study a
system (e.g., a gaming application) where network virtualization
is used to support thin client applications for mobile devices to
improve their QoS. To deal with the dynamics of both the mobile
clients as well as the ability to migrate services closer to the
client location we advocate, in this paper, the use of competitive
analysis. After identifying the parameters that characterize the
cost-benefit tradeoff for this kind of application we propose an
online migration strategy. The strength of the strategy is that it
is robust with regards to any arbitrary request access pattern. In
particular, it is close to the optimal offline algorithm that knows
the access pattern in advance.
In this paper we present both an optimal offline algorithm based on
dynamic programming techniques to find the best migration paths for
a given request sequence, and a ıt O($μ;$log n)-competitive
migration strategy Mig where $μ$ is the ratio between maximal and
minimal link capacity in the substrate network for a simplified
model. This is almost optimal for small $μ;$, as we also show that
there are networks where no online algorithm can achieve a ratio
below ıt $Ømega$(log n/log log n). In contrast, the optimal
solution without migration can only achieve a competitive ratio that
is linear in the network diameter. Our simulations indicate that the
competitive ratio of Mig is robust to the network size, and that the
ratio is small if the request},
