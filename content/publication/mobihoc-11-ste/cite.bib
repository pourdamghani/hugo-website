 abstract = {Electing a leader is a fundamental task in distributed
computations. Many coordination problems, such as the access to a
shared resource, and the resulting inefficiencies, can be avoided by
relying on a leader. This paper presents SELECT, a leader election
protocol for wireless networks where nodes communicate over a
shared medium. SELECT is very robust in two respects. First, the
protocol is self-stabilizing in the sense that it converges to a
correct solution from any possible initial network state (e.g.,
where no or multiple nodes consider themselves a leader). This is
an appealing property, especially for dynamic networks. Second, the
described protocol is resilient against a powerful reactive jammer
that blocks a significant fraction of all communication rounds. The
reactive model is general and of interest beyond jamming (e.g., in
the context of co-existing networks). The paper also reports on
experimental results obtained from our simulation framework which
allows us to study convergence behavior under different types of
adversarial jammers.},
