 abstract = {While it is well-known that BitTorrent is vulnerable to
selfish behavior, this paper demonstrates that even entire files
can be downloaded without reciprocating at all in BitTorrent. To
this end, we present ıt BitThief, a free riding client that
never contributes any real data. First, we show that simple tricks
suffice in order to achieve high download rates, ıt even in the
absence of seeders. We also illustrate how peers in a swarm react
to various sophisticated attacks. Moreover, our analysis reveals
that ıt sharing communities---communities originally intended to
offer downloads of good quality and to promote cooperation among
peers---provide many incentives to cheat.},
