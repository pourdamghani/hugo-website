 abstract = {This paper studies the problem of computing the most
frequent element (the mode) by means of a distributed algorithm
where the elements are located at the nodes of a network. Let ıt
k denote the number of distinct elements and further let ıt m_i
be the number of occurrences of the element ıt e_i in the ordered
list of occurrences ıt m_1>m_2>=...>=m_k. We give a deterministic
distributed algorithm with time complexity ıt O(D+k) where ıt
D denotes the diameter of the graph, which is essentially tight. As
our main contribution, a Monte Carlo algorithm is presented which
computes the mode in ıt O(D + F_2/m_1^2 log k) time with high
probability, where the frequency moment ıt F_l is defined as ıt
F_l = Sum_(i=1)^k m_i^l. This algorithm is substantially faster
than the deterministic algorithm for various relevant frequency
distributions. Moreover, we provide a lower bound of ıt $Ømega$(D
+ F_5/(m_1^5 B)), where ıt B is the maximum message size,
that captures the eect of the frequency distribution on the time
complexity to compute the mode.},
