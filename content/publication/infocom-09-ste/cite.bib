 abstract = {Many wireless standards and protocols today, such as
WLAN and Bluetooth, operate on similar frequency bands. While
this permits an efficient usage of the limited medium capacity,
transmissions of nodes running different protocols can interfere.
This paper studies how to design node discovery algorithms for
wireless multichannel networks which are robust against contending
protocols on the shared medium. We pursue a conservative approach
and consider a Byzantine adversary who prevents the communication of
our protocol on ıt t channels in a worst-case fashion. Our model
also captures disruptions controlled by an adversarial jammer. This
paper presents algorithms for scenarios where ıt t is not known.
The analytical findings are complemented by simulations providing
evidence that the proposed protocols perform well in practice.},
