 abstract = {This brief announcement proposes a new model to measure
the distributed time complexity of topological self-stabilization.
In the field of topological self-stabilization, nodes---e.g.,
machines in a p2p network---seek to establish a certain network
structure in a robust manner (see, e.g., [2] for a distributed
algorithm for skip graphs). While several complexity models have
been proposed and analyzed over the last years, these models are
often inappropriate to adequately model parallel efficiency: either
they are overly pessimistic in the sense that they can force the
algorithm to work serially, or they are too optimistic in the sense
that contention issues are neglected. We hope that our approach will
inspire researchers in the community to analyze other problems from
this perspective. For a complete technical report about our model,
related literature and algorithms, the reader is referred to [1].},
