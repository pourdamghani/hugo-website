abstract: "This paper presents the distributed and randomized Medium Access Control protocol Jade for multi-hop wireless networks with a single communication channel. Jade guarantees a high throughput despite a powerful adversary that is able to jam (groups of) nodes individually and during a (1-$ε$)-fraction of the entire time, where $ε$>0 is an arbitrarily small constant. We show that despite this harsh environment, Jade features a good performance as nodes are able to exploit the few non- jammed slots effectively."
