 abstract = {This paper presents the distributed and randomized Medium
Access Control protocol Jade for multi-hop wireless networks with
a single communication channel. Jade guarantees a high throughput
despite a powerful adversary that is able to jam (groups of) nodes
individually and during a (1-$ε$)-fraction of the entire
time, where $ε$>0 is an arbitrarily small constant. We
show that despite this harsh environment, Jade features a good
performance as nodes are able to exploit the few non- jammed slots
effectively.},
