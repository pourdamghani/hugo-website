 abstract = {Peer-to-peer systems rely on scalable overlay networks
that enable efficient routing between its members. Hypercubic
topologies facilitate such operations while each node only needs
to connect to a small number of other nodes. In contrast to static
communication networks, peer-to-peer networks allow nodes to adapt
their neighbor set over time in order to react to join and leave
events and failures. This paper shows how to maintain such networks
in a robust manner. Concretely, we present a distributed and
self-stabilizing algorithm that constructs a (variant of the) skip
graph in polylogarithmic time from any initial state in which the
overlay network is still weakly connected. This is an exponential
improvement compared to previously known self-stabilizing algorithms
for overlay networks. In addition, individual joins and leaves are
handled locally and require little work.},
