 abstract = {Network virtualization is an important concept to overcome
the ossification of today's Internet as if facilitates innovation
also in the network core and as it promises a more efficient
use of the given resources and infrastructure. Virtual networks
(VNets) provide an abstraction of the physical network: multiple
VNets may cohabit the same physical network, but can be based on
completely different protocol stacks (also beyond IP). One of the
main challenges in network virtualization is the efficient admission
control and embedding of VNets. The demand for virtual networks
(e.g., for a video conference) can be hard to predict, and once the
request is accepted, the specification / QoS guarantees must be
ensured throughout the VNet�s lifetime. This requires an admission
control algorithm which only selects high-benefit VNets in times
of scarce resources, and an embedding algorithm which realizes the
VNet in such a way that the likelihood that future requests can be
embedded as well is maximized.
This paper describes a generic algorithm for the online VNet
embedding problem which does not rely on any knowledge of the
future VNet requests but whose performance is competitive to an
optimal offline algorithm that has complete knowledge of the request
sequence in advance: the so-called competitive ratio is, loosely
speaking, logarithmic in the sum of the resources. Our algorithm
is generic in the sense that it supports multiple traffic models,
multiple routing models, and even allows for nonuniform benefits
and durations of VNet requests. Concretely, the routing models
considered in this paper include: multipaths, single paths, and tree
routing. For modeling traffic, we study the customer-pipe model, the
hose model, and a new traffic model, called ıt aggregate ingress
model, that is well suited for modeling multicasts and multi-party
video conferences.},
