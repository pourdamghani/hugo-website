 abstract = {In contrast to peer-to-peer file sharing, live streaming
based on peer-to-peer technology is still awaiting its breakthrough.
This may be due to the additional challenges live streaming faces,
e.g., the need to meet real-time playback deadlines, or the
increased demands on robustness under churn. This paper presents
and evaluates novel neighbor selection and data distribution
schemes for peer-to-peer live streaming. Concretely, in order to
distribute data efficiently and with minimal delay, our algorithms
combine low-latency push operations along a structured overlay with
the flexibility of pull operations. The protocols ensure that all
peers are able to obtain the required data blocks of a live stream
in time, and that due to the loop-free dissemination paths, the
overhead is low.},
