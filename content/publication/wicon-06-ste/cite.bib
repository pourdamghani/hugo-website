 abstract = {It is well-known that TCP performs poorly in the presence
of packet losses happening for reasons other than Internet
congestion. One increasingly important source of such errors are
wireless links. In this paper, networks are studied where the
congestion--and thus the bandwidth available to a host--varies over
time, and where in addition packets are lost at random. First, we
propose a network comprising both dynamically varying congestion and
random errors. Second, our model is extended with network calculus
concepts in order to study bursty changes of congestion. Finally, we
present the transfer protocol TCP ``Wichita'' (TCPW) which achieves
a provable worst-case performance in this environment.},
