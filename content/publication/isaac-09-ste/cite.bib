 abstract = {This paper studies the construction of self-stabilizing
topologies for distributed systems. While recent research has
focused on chain topologies where nodes need to be linearized with
respect to their identifiers, we go a step further and explore a
natural 2-dimensional generalization. In particular, we present a
local self-stabilizing algorithm that constructs a Delaunay graph
from any initial connected topology and in a distributed manner.
This algorithm terminates in time Ä±t O(n_3) in the worst-case.
We believe that such self-stabilizing Delaunay networks have
interesting applications and give insights into the necessary
geometric reasoning that is required for higher-dimensional
linearization problems.},
