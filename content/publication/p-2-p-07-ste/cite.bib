 abstract = {Tit-for-tat is widely believed to be the most effective
strategy to enforce collaboration among selfish users. However, it
has been shown that its usefulness for decentralized and dynamic
environments such as peer-to-peer networks is marginal, as peers
can rapidly end up in a deadlock situation. Many proposed solutions
to this problem are either less resilient to freeloading behavior
or induce a computational overhead that cannot be sustained by
regular peers. In contrast, we retain tit-for-tat, but enhance the
system with a novel form of source coding and an effective scheme to
prevent peers from freeloading from seeding peers. We show that our
system performs well without the risk of peer starvation and without
sacrificing fairness. The proposed solution has a reasonably low
overhead, and may hence be suitable for fully distributed content
distribution applications in real networks.},
