 abstract = {Lucrative incentives in grid computing do not only attract
honest participants, but also cheaters. To prevent selfish behavior,
verification mechanisms are required. Today's solutions mostly base
on redundancy and inherently exhibit a considerable overhead. Often,
however, the verification of a result takes much less time than its
computation. In this paper we propose a distributed checking scheme
that exploits this asymmetry. Our mechanism detects wrong results
and excludes cheaters in a distributed manner and hence disburdens
the central grid server. We show how the verification scheme is used
in an application which aims at breaking the discrete logarithm
problem by a parallel implementation of the Pollard-$hÌŠo$ algorithm.
Our implementation extends the BOINC server software and is robust
to various rational attacks even in the presence of colluders.},
