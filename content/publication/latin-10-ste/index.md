abstract: "Topological self-stabilization is an important concept to build robust open distributed systems (such as peer-to-peer systems) where nodes can organize themselves into meaningful network topologies. The goal is to devise distributed algorithms that converge quickly to such a desirable topology, independently of the initial network state. This paper proposes a new model to study the parallel convergence time. Our model sheds light on the achievable parallelism by avoiding bottlenecks of existing models that can yield a distorted picture. As a case study, we consider local graph linearization--i.e., how to build a sorted list of the nodes of a connected graph in a distributed and self-stabilizing manner. We propose two variants of a simple algorithm, and provide an extensive formal analysis of their worst-case and best-case parallel time complexities, as well as their performance under a greedy selection of the actions to be executed."
