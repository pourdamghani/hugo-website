 abstract = {Topological self-stabilization is an important concept
to build robust open distributed systems (such as peer-to-peer
systems) where nodes can organize themselves into meaningful network
topologies. The goal is to devise distributed algorithms that
converge quickly to such a desirable topology, independently of the
initial network state. This paper proposes a new model to study the
parallel convergence time. Our model sheds light on the achievable
parallelism by avoiding bottlenecks of existing models that can
yield a distorted picture. As a case study, we consider local graph
linearization--i.e., how to build a sorted list of the nodes of a
connected graph in a distributed and self-stabilizing manner. We
propose two variants of a simple algorithm, and provide an extensive
formal analysis of their worst-case and best-case parallel time
complexities, as well as their performance under a greedy selection
of the actions to be executed.},
