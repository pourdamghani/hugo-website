 abstract = {Peer-to-peer systems (p2p) are highly dynamic in nature.
They may consist of millions of peers joining only for a limited
period of time, resulting in hundreds of join and leave events
per second. In this paper we introduce eQuus, a novel distributed
hash table (DHT) suitable for highly dynamic environments. eQuus
guarantees that lookups are always fast---in terms of both the delay
and the total number of routing hops---, although peers may join and
leave the network at any time and concurrently.},
