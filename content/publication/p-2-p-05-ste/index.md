abstract: "Peer-to-peer systems (p2p) are highly dynamic in nature. They may consist of millions of peers joining only for a limited period of time, resulting in hundreds of join and leave events per second. In this paper we introduce eQuus, a novel distributed hash table (DHT) suitable for highly dynamic environments. eQuus guarantees that lookups are always fast---in terms of both the delay and the total number of routing hops---, although peers may join and leave the network at any time and concurrently."
