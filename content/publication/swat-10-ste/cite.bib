 abstract = {We attend to the classic setting where an observer needs
to inform a tracker about an arbitrary time varying function 覺t
f:N_0-->Z. This is an optimization problem, where both wrong
values at the tracker and sending updates entail a certain cost.
We consider an online variant of this problem, i.e., at time 覺t
t, the observer only knows 覺t f(t') for all 覺t t'=<t. In
this paper, we generalize existing cost models (with an emphasis on
concave and convex penalties) and present two online algorithms. Our
analysis shows that these algorithms perform well in a large class
of models, and are even optimal in some settings.},
