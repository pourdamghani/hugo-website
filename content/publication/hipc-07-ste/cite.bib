 abstract = {Flooding is a fundamental building block of unstructured
peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. In this paper, we investigate techniques
to improve the performance of flooding. In particular, we present
Ä±t Clustella, a novel semi-structured P2P architecture with
bounded peer degree. Clustella decomposes the network into different
clusters, allowing peers to quickly find those neighbors which
contribute much to their routing efficiency. By its link selection
strategy, Clustella achieves a good performance in static and
dynamic environments.},
