abstract: "Flooding is a fundamental building block of unstructured peer-to-peer (P2P) systems. In this paper, we investigate techniques to improve the performance of flooding. In particular, we present Ä±t Clustella, a novel semi-structured P2P architecture with bounded peer degree. Clustella decomposes the network into different clusters, allowing peers to quickly find those neighbors which contribute much to their routing efficiency. By its link selection strategy, Clustella achieves a good performance in static and dynamic environments."
