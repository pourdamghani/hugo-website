 abstract = {Although several fully decentralized peer-to-peer systems
have been proposed in the literature, most existing systems still
employ a centralized architecture. In order to compare these two
paradigms, as a case study, we conduct measurements in the eDonkey
and the Kad network&mdash;two of the most popular peer-to-peer
systems in use today. We reengineered the eDonkey server software
and integrated two modified servers into the eDonkey network in
order to monitor traffic. Additionally, we implemented a Kad client
exploiting a design weakness to spy on the traffic at arbitrary
locations in the ID space. The goal of this study is to provide
insight into the spacial and temporal distributions of the peers'
activities and also examine the searched contents. Finally, we
discuss problems related to the collection of such data sets and
investigate techniques to verify the representativeness of the
measured data.},
