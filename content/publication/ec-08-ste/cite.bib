 abstract = {This paper studies a virus inoculation game on social
networks. A framework is presented which allows the measuring of
the windfall of friendship, i.e., how much players benefit if they
care about the welfare of their direct neighbors in the social
network graph compared to purely selfish environments. We analyze
the corresponding equilibria and show that the computation of the
worst and best Nash equilibrium is \bf NP-hard. Intriguingly, even
though the windfall of friendship can never be negative, the social
welfare does not increase monotonically with the extent to which
players care for each other. While these phenomena are known on an
anecdotal level, our framework allows us to quantify these effects
analytically.},
