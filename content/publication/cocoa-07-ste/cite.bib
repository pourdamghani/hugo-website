 abstract = {This paper attends to the problem of a mechanism designer
seeking to influence the outcome of a strategic game based on her
creditability. The mechanism designer offers additional payments
to the players depending on their mutual choice of strategies in
order to steer them to certain decisions. Of course, the mechanism
designer aims at spending as little as possible and yet implementing
her desired outcome. We present several algorithms for this
optimization problem both for singleton target strategy profiles and
target strategy profile regions. Furthermore, the paper shows how a
bankrupt mechanism designer can decide efficiently whether strategy
profiles can be implemented at no cost at all. Finally, risk-averse
players and dynamic games are examined.},
