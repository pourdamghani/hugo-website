 abstract = {Over the last years, game theory has provided insights
into the behavior of distributed systems by modeling the players
as utility maximizing agents. In particular, it has been shown
that selfishness causes many systems to perform in a globally
suboptimal fashion. Such systems are said to have a large ıt Price
of Anarchy. In this article, we extend this field of research by
allowing some players to be malicious rather than selfish. We ask:
What is the impact of malicious players on the system consisting
of otherwise selfish players? In particular, we introduce the ıt
Price of Malice as a measure that captures how much the system's
efficiency degrades in the presence of malicious players, compared
to a purely selfish environment. As a specific example, we analyze
the Price of Malice of a game which models the containment of the
spread of viruses. In this game, each player or node can choose
whether or not to install anti-virus software. Then, a virus starts
from a random node and recursively infects all neighboring nodes
which are not inoculated. We establish various results about this
game. For instance, we quantify how much the presence of malicious
players can deteriorate or--in case of highly risk-averse selfish
players--improve the social welfare of the distributed system.},
