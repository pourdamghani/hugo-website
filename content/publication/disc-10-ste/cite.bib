 abstract = {This paper presents a simple local medium access control
protocol, called Jade, for multi-hop wireless networks with a
single channel that is provably robust against adaptive adversarial
jamming. The wireless network is modeled as a unit disk graph on a
set of nodes distributed arbitrarily in the plane. In addition to
these nodes, there are adversarial jammers that know the protocol
and its entire history and that are allowed to jam the wireless
channel at any node for an arbitrary (1-$ε$)-fraction of the
time steps, where 0<$ε$<1 is an arbitrary constant. We assume
that the nodes cannot distinguish between jammed transmissions
and collisions of regular messages. Nevertheless, we show that
Jade achieves an asymptotically optimal throughput if there is a
sufficiently dense distribution of nodes.},
