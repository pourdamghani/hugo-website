 abstract = {Since the demise of the Overnet network, the Kad network
has become not only the most popular but also the only widely
used peer-to-peer system based on a distributed hash table. It is
likely that its user base will continue to grow in numbers over the
next few years as, unlike the eDonkey network, it does not depend
on central servers, which increases scalability and reliability.
Moreover, the Kad network is more efficient than unstructured
systems such as Gnutella. However, we show that today's Kad network
can be attacked in several ways by carrying out several (well-known)
attacks on the Kad network. The presented attacks could be used
either to hamper the correct functioning of the network itself,
to censor contents, or to harm other entities in the Internet not
participating in the Kad network such as ordinary web servers. While
there are simple heuristics to reduce the impact of some of the
attacks, we believe that the presented attacks cannot be thwarted
easily in any fully decentralized peer-to-peer system without some
kind of a centralized certification and verification authority.},
