 abstract = {Current peer-to-peer (P2P) systems often suffer from a
large fraction of freeriders not contributing any resources to the
network. Various mechanisms have been designed to overcome this
problem. However, the selfish behavior of peers has aspects which
go beyond resource sharing. This paper studies the effects on the
topology of a P2P network if peers selfishly select the peers to
connect to. In our model, a peer exploits locality properties in
order to minimize the latency (or response times) of its lookup
operations. At the same time, the peer aims at not having to
maintain links to too many other peers in the system. We show
that the resulting topologies can be much worse than if peers
collaborated. Moreover, the network may never stabilize, even in the
absence of churn.},
