 abstract = {This article studies how a mechanism designer can
influence games by promising payments to the players depending
on their mutual choice of strategies. First, we investigate the
cost of implementing a desirable behavior and present algorithms
to compute this cost. Whereas a mechanism designer can decide
efficiently whether strategy profiles can be implemented at no cost
at all our complexity analysis indicates that computing an optimal
implementation is generally \bf NP-hard.
Second, we introduce and analyze the concept of Ä±t leverage in
a game. The leverage captures the benefits that a benevolent or a
malicious mechanism designer can achieve by implementing a certain
strategy profile region within economic reason, i.e., by taking the
implementation cost into account. Mechanism designers can often
manipulate games and change the social welfare by a larger extent
than the amount of money invested. Unfortunately, computing the
leverage turns out to be intractable as well in the general case.},
