 abstract = {Many distributed systems can be modeled as network games:
a collection of ıt selfish players that communicate in order to
maximize their individual utilities. The performance of such games
can be evaluated through the costs of the system ıt equilibria:
the system states in which no player can increase her utility by
unilaterally changing her behavior. However, assuming that all
players are selfish and in particular that all players have the
same utility function may not always be appropriate. Hence, several
extensions to incorporate also altruistic and malicious behavior
in addition to selfishness have been proposed over the last years.
In this paper, we seek to go one step further and study arbitrary
relationships between participants. In particular, we introduce the
notion of the ıt social range matrix and explore the effects of
the social range matrix on the equilibria in a network game. In
order to derive concrete results, we propose a simplistic network
creation game that captures the effect of social relationships among
players.},
