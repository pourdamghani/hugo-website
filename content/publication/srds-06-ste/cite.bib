 abstract = {We present Cryptree, a cryptographic tree structure which
facilitates access control in file systems operating on untrusted
storage. Cryptree leverages the file system's folder hierarchy to
achieve efficient and intuitive, yet simple, access control. The
highlights are its ability to recursively grant access to a folder
and all its subfolders in constant time, the dynamic inheritance
of access rights which inherently prevents scattering of access
rights, and the possibility to grant someone access to a file or
folder without revealing the identities of other accessors. To
reason about and to visualize Cryptree, we introduce the notion
of cryptographic links. We describe the Cryptrees we have used to
enforce read and write access in our own file system. Finally, we
measure the performance of the Cryptree and compare it to other
approaches.},
