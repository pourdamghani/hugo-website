abstract: "Until now, the analysis of fault tolerance of peer-to-peer systems usually only covers random faults of some kind. Contrary to traditional algorithmic research, faults as well as joins and leaves occurring in a worst-case manner are hardly considered. In this article, we devise techniques to build dynamic peer-to-peer systems which remain fully functional in spite of an adversary who continuously adds and removes peers. We exemplify our algorithms on hypercube and pancake topologies and present a system which maintains small peer degree and network diameter."
