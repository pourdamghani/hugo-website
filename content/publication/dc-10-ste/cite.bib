 abstract = {Until now, the analysis of fault tolerance of peer-to-peer
systems usually only covers random faults of some kind. Contrary
to traditional algorithmic research, faults as well as joins and
leaves occurring in a worst-case manner are hardly considered. In
this article, we devise techniques to build dynamic peer-to-peer
systems which remain fully functional in spite of an adversary who
continuously adds and removes peers. We exemplify our algorithms
on hypercube and pancake topologies and present a system which
maintains small peer degree and network diameter.},
