 abstract = {This paper studies local-control strategies to estimate
the size of a certain event affecting an arbitrary connected subset
of the nodes in a network. For example, our algorithms allow
nodes in a peer-to-peer system to explore the remaining connected
components after a Denial-of-Service attack, or nodes in a sensor
network to assess the magnitude of a certain environmental event.
In our model, each node can keep some extra information about its
neighborhood computed during the deployment phase of the network. On
the arrival of the event, the goal of the active nodes is to learn
the network topology induced by the event, without the help of the
remaining nodes. This paper studies the tradeoffs between message
and time complexity of possible distributed solutions.},
