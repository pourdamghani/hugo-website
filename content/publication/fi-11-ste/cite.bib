 abstract = {This article reports on the results of our measurement
study of the Kad network. Although several fully decentralized
peer-to-peer systems have been proposed in the literature, most
existing systems still employ a centralized architecture. The Kad
network is a notable exception. Since the demise of the Overnet
network, the Kad network has become the most popular peer-to-peer
system based on a distributed hash table. It is likely that its user
base will continue to grow in numbers over the next few years due to
the system's scalability and reliability.
The contribution of the article is twofold. First, we compare the
two networks accessed by eMule: the centralized paradigm of the
eDonkey network and the structured, distributed approach pursued
by the Kad network. We re-engineer the eDonkey server software
and integrate two modified servers into the eDonkey network in
order to monitor traffic. Additionally, we implement a Kad client
exploiting a design weakness to spy on the traffic at arbitrary
locations in the ID space. The collected data provides insights
into the spacial and temporal distributions of the peers' activity.
Moreover, it allows us to study the searched content. The article
also discusses problems related to the collection of such data sets
and investigates techniques to verify the representativeness of the
measured data.
Second, this article shows that today's Kad network can be attacked
in several ways. Our simple attacks could be used either to hamper
the correct functioning of the network itself, to censor content, or
to harm other entities in the Internet not participating in the Kad
network, such as ordinary web servers. While there are heuristics to
improve the robustness of Kad, we believe that the attacks cannot be
thwarted easily in a fully decentralized peer-to-peer system, i.e.,
without some kind of a centralized certification and verification
authority. This result may be relevant in the context of the current
debate on the design of a clean-slate network architecture for the
Internet which is based on concepts known from the peer-to-peer
paradigm.},
