 abstract = {This paper studies to which extent the social welfare of a
game can be influenced by an interested third party within economic
reason, i.e., by taking the implementation cost into account.
Besides considering classic, benevolent mechanism designers, we also
analyze malicious mechanism designers. For instance, this paper
shows that a malicious mechanism designer can often corrupt games
and worsen the players' situation to a larger extent than the amount
of money invested. Surprisingly, no money is needed at all in some
cases. We provide algorithms for finding the so-called leverage in
games and show that for optimistic mechanism designers, computing
the leverage or approximations thereof is \bf NP-hard.},
