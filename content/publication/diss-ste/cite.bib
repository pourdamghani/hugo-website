 abstract = {Peer-to-peer (p2p) computing is one of the most
intriguing new networking paradigms of the last ten years, and many
applications today use peer-to-peer technology, e.g. for large
distributed computations, for file sharing, or for live media
streaming. At the heart of the paradigm lies the idea of leveraging
the resources of the system's participants. Thus, potentially
scalable and robust architectures can be built.
However, making use of the decentralized resources is challenging.
The peers are under the control of the individual users who may only
connect to the network for a short period of time. Consequently,
there are frequent membership changes and p2p systems are highly
dynamic. In addition to regular joins and leaves, the participating
machines (often unreliable desktops) may crash. Peer-to-peer
solutions are also faced with the fact that it is not always in
the (anonymous) users' interest to contribute their resources.
Rather, a user may be selfish and seek to exploit the system without
reciprocating.
This dissertation studies the challenges of the dynamics in p2p
computing and of cooperation. We describe a system which is
based on a hypercubic topology and which applies algorithms that
maintain desirable network properties despite worst-case joins
and leaves; these algorithms can also be used for pancake graphs.
Besides membership dynamics, we investigate dynamic changes of
the available bandwidth between two peers, and we analyze the
throughput of different transfer protocols. In order to emphasize
the importance of the cooperation challenge, we conduct a case study
of BitTorrent--one of the most traffic intensive applications on
the Internet--, and show that today's peer-to-peer networks still
fail to fend off uncooperative peers. A game-theoretic analysis
of a p2p network creation game is presented which estimates the
impact of selfish behavior. We find that both the performance and
the stability of a system can suffer severely. In addition, this
dissertation introduces a mathematical framework which allows
us to evaluate a system's robustness to malicious attacks; the
framework is also useful for the analysis of social networks. The
theoretic findings are complemented by a case study which identifies
vulnerabilities in the popular Kad network.},
