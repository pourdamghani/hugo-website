 abstract = {Among the foremost goals of topology control in wireless
ad-hoc networks is interference reduction. This paper presents a
receiver-centric interference model featuring two main advantages
over previous work. First, it reflects the fact that interference
occurs at the intended receiver of a message. Second, the presented
interference measure is robust with respect to addition or removal
of single network nodes. Regarding both of these aspects our
model intuitively corresponds to the behavior of interference in
reality. Based on this interference model, we show that currently
known topology control algorithms poorly reduce interference.
Motivated by the observation that already one-dimensional network
instances display the intricacy of the considered problem, we
continue to focus on the so-called highway model. Setting out
to analyze the special case of the exponential node chain, we
eventually describe an algorithm guaranteeing to achieve a ıt
&nthroot;$Δ$-approximation (where ıt n=4) of the optimal
connectivity-preserving topology in the general highway model.},
